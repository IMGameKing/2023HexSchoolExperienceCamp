          <a href="#">Mickey Mouse</a> would have to be the main figure. Yet
          some mention must be made of our great animated classics. I made
          sketches of all the characters I thought should appear. Then, I called
          upon my modeling skills to build a one-16th-inch scale paper cut-out
          model of what I wanted. This was before photo-copying machines with
          reducing capabilities, so I had to make all the drawings in scale.
          Many of the figures had to be drawn, a quarter-inch high. The entire
          set was about 18-inches long by 3.5-inches high. But this model was a
          good tool for planning the show sequence and experimenting with
          different scenes.
